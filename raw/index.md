# Raw Sources Index

Catalogue of source documents stored in `raw/`. This file is the source of truth for source IDs. LLM reads; user and LLM both write entries here during ingest.

## Conventions

- Every source gets a three-digit ID: `src-001`, `src-002`, …
- IDs are monotonically increasing across the whole `raw/` tree (not per-subdirectory).
- Files in `raw/` are named `NNN-slug.ext` where `NNN` matches the ID.
- Entries in this file are grouped by category, ordered by ID within a category.

## Entry template

```
